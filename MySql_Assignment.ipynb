    "SQL vs. NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases\n",
    "- Structure: SQL databases are relational, meaning data is stored in tables with predefined schemas. Each table has rows and columns, and relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys.\n",
    "- Schema: They use a fixed schema, requiring the definition of tables and columns before data entry.\n",
    "- Query Language: SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "- Scalability: Generally, SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they scale by increasing the capacity of a single server.\n",
    "- Consistency and Transactions: SQL databases are ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring reliable transactions and consistency.\n",
    "- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases\n",
    "- Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store data in various formats, such as document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph-based structures.\n",
    "- Schema: They often have dynamic schemas, allowing for flexible and rapid changes to data structures without predefined schemas.\n",
    "- Query Language: NoSQL databases use various query languages depending on the database type, often more flexible and sometimes proprietary.\n",
    "- Scalability: NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable, meaning they scale out by adding more servers.\n",
    "- Consistency and Transactions: NoSQL databases often sacrifice strict ACID compliance for BASE properties (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) to achieve higher performance and scalability.\n",
    "- Examples: MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (wide-column), Neo4j (graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "1) Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL: Structured and table-based.\n",
    "- NoSQL: Flexible and various models (document, key-value, wide-column, graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL: Fixed schema, requiring prior definition.\n",
    "- NoSQL: Dynamic schema, allowing on-the-fly changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL: Vertical scalability.\n",
    "- NoSQL: Horizontal scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL: Standardized SQL language.\n",
    "- NoSQL: Various languages, often more flexible but can be proprietary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL: Strong ACID properties.\n",
    "- NoSQL: Generally weaker ACID properties, focusing on performance and availability (BASE).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL: Suitable for complex queries, transactional applications, and applications requiring strong consistency.\n",
    "- NoSQL: Suitable for large-scale data, real-time web applications, and applications requiring high availability and scalability."
